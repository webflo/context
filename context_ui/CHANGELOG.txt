context_ui DRUPAL-6--1
----------------------
- Update to README.txt to reflect updated menu links functionality and
  include basic list of hooks provided by context_ui.
- Update to DB schema to reflect new storage system. Update script
  included.
- Improved namespace consistency -- all hooks now use context_ui
  rather that context as their function prefix.
- Moved deprecated functions / backwards-compatibility functions to
  the end of context_ui.module.
- Major refactoring of context storage schema. Contexts are now cached
  for performance and default contexts are no longer stored in the
  database.
- Updated context_ui_block_list() to respect block visbility
  and title customizations made through the block module.
